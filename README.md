		Discuss with the group why it’s important to use clear and
descriptive branch names.
Choosing good branch names is crucial for maintaining an organized repository. 
Good branch names are usually: Descriptive: Names should reflect the branch's
 purpose or task.
 Concise: Keep names short and to the point.
 Resolving merge conflicts
 
• Conflicts: What happens when two group members modify the same file? How would you
resolve merge conflicts within your group?
If your merge conflict is caused by competing line changes, such as when people make
 different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository,
 you can resolve it on GitHub using the conflict editor.

 • Reverting Changes: If something breaks after merging a pull request, how would you
revert back to a stable version of the project?

 Under your repository name, click Pull requests. In the "Pull Requests" list,
  click the pull request you'd like to revert. Near the bottom of the pull request, click Revert.
  If the Revert option isn't displayed, you'll need to ask the repository 
  administrator for write permissions.

 • Best Practices: Discuss the importance of small and frequent commits versus large and
single commits
  If the size of the code is large, the frequency of code commits is less.
   For better early visibility and sharing code with other team members and other
    teams early on, to limit their waiting time on code dependency,
   it is a good practice to commit in small chunks often and as early as possible.
